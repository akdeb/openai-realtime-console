## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm for the frontend
- PlatformIO for ESP32 firmware development
- ESP32-S3 development board (recommended)
- I2S MEMS microphone (like INMP441)
- I2S amplifier and speaker (like MAX98357A)

### Quick Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/esp32-openai.git
   cd esp32-openai
   ```

2. **Set up the Frontend**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   # Configure environment variables
   cp .env.local.example .env.local
   # Edit .env.local with your Supabase credentials
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Build and Flash the ESP32 Firmware**
   ```bash
   cd ../esp32
   # Open in PlatformIO and build
   # Flash to your ESP32 device
   ```

4. **Connect your ESP32 device to WiFi**
   - Power on the device
